### MAIN PROGRAM OPTIONS:

### FILTER PARAMETERS:

### MOTION MODEL PARAMETERS:
class u_noise(object):
    x_rel = 0.150 # x noise (relative) in percent (0.01 = 1%)
    x_abs = 0.005 # x noise (absolute) in meters
    y_rel = 0.001 # y noise should mostly come from theta noise, since robot can't move sideways
    y_abs = 0.005 # y noise (absolute) in meters
    theta_rel = 0.200 # heading noise (relative) in percent (0.01 = 1%)
    theta_abs = 0.020 # heading noise (absolute) in radians


### MEASUREMENT MODEL PARAMETERS:
class z_noise(object):
    r_rel = 0.10 # range noise (relative) in percent (0.01 = 1%)
    r_abs = 0.05 # range noise (absolute) in meters
    # b_rel = 0.10 # doesn't make sense to have this, measurement angle should not affect accuracy
    b_abs = 0.20 # bearing noise - unitless since using cosine comparison

# particles far from a measurement will give us 0.0 for a probability
# due to floating point limits. Once we hit zero we can never recover,
# so add some small nonzero value to all points.
min_prob = 1e-12 # prevents NaNs and particle deprivation if prob = 0
